		<p> Trims like the 2014 Dodge Challenger SXT are sharp and aggressive-looking, and squeeze 305 hp from their 3.6L, six-cylinder engines. They ride on tall, 20-inch-plus alloy wheels, and give you some sharp features the original 1970s Challenger never had, including traction control and Bluetooth®.</p>
