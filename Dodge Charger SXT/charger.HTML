		<p> The 2015 Dodge Charger SXT comes with heated and cooled front seats, in addition to a V6 that puts out 292 hp. This trim is also available with all-wheel drive! This Charger is a big, slab-sided, four-door sedan with an imposing exterior. But inside itâ€™s all comfy, with a heated steering wheel, front leather seats, and thoughtful driver aids like automatic cruise control and lane departure warning.</p>
