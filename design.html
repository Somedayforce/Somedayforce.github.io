					<p>We are not architects. But as design-oriented builders we can help you think through all aspects of your project, from the creation of a vision through to execution. We can be your “project sherpa”, helping to guide you through aesthetic, practical, technical and financial considerations in a thoughtful, unified process.</p>

				<td	width = "50%" height = "400"><h1 style="text-align:center">interior design and advice</h1>
				<p>For both commercial and residential projects, we bring the same holistic mindset to interior design. With kitchens and bathrooms, we try to equally balance aesthetic and practical considerations. In choosing colors, home furnishings and lighting, we bring a design sensibility that balances style, quality, livability and cost.</p></td>

				<td width = "50%" height = "400"><h1 style="text-align:center">color consulting and paint</h1>
					<p>We provide color consulting as part of our interior design services and are the Hudson Valley’s only dealer of C2 paints. A kindred spirit to our other design offerings, C2 paints are designer-oriented line of paints and stains that have a more complex and nuanced color palate than other national brands and yet are the same in terms of price point and usability.</p>

				<td width = "50%" height = "400"><h1 style="text-align:center">landscape design and advice</h1>
					<p>As complete-project developers, we bring together site planning, infrastructure development and environmentally sensitive landscape design. Always looking to preserve the natural beauty of the site and minimize impact, we manage a process that balances aesthetic objectives with civil engineering considerations and zoning requirements.</p>
