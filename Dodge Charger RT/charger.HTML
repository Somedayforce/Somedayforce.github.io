		<p> The R/T trim is shorthand for road or track use, which you could conceivably manage in this high-performance model. Lift the hood on a 2014 Dodge Charger R/T ;and you’ll find a 370-hp Hemi® V8 glaring back at you, all torquey and mean-sounding. Look inside this four-door sedan, as we did in our Dodge Charger vs. Dodge Avenger article, and you’ll find it packed with features like leather seats, a sunroof, and a heated steering wheel.</p>
